# Question

In what situations is a `while` loop better than a `for` loop?

# Answer

While loops are better when you don't know how many times something is going to iterate. When using while loops, you depend on what is "true" to set your conditions, rather than a preemptive condition that is known. Like we don't know how long I'll be scrolling through instagram, so you'd use a while loop to generate posts (while user is still interacting with site in this manner (scrolling), fetch more posts from the user's following pool).
